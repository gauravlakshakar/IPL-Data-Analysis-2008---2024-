# 📊 IPL Data Analysis (2008 - 2024)

## 🏏 Introduction
The Indian Premier League (IPL) has evolved into one of the most exciting and competitive T20 leagues in the world. Since its inception in 2008, it has witnessed intense rivalries, exceptional individual performances, and historic moments that have shaped the landscape of modern cricket. This project, **IPL Data Analysis (2008-2024)**, is an attempt to systematically explore and analyze IPL data spanning across multiple seasons to extract meaningful insights. Through this project, we aim to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and significant statistics that help us better understand the dynamics of the tournament.

📚 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze key aspects of IPL matches using an interactive dashboard. By leveraging historical data, we explore player performances, team trends, and match statistics to gain valuable insights. The dashboard provides a data-driven perspective on different factors that influence match outcomes, including batting trends, dismissal patterns, and team performances.


The analysis covers:


Scoring Trends: Examining total runs scored and extra deliveries across IPL matches.

Player Performance: Analyzing key batting metrics like non-striker contributions, dismissals, and innings played.

Team Strategies: Understanding how different teams perform in terms of total balls faced and dismissal types.

Fielding & Bowling Impact: Evaluating bowlers based on dismissal kinds and fielders based on their role in dismissals.

Venue & Match Dynamics: Assessing how different stadiums and match conditions affect player and team performances.
